This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This may enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverse tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. PARPs are enzymes activated by single-strand DNA breaks that catalyze the post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, which induces signaling and the recruitment of other proteins to repair damaged DNA. The PARP-mediated repair pathway plays a key role in DNA repair and is dysregulated in a variety of cancer cell types. "

This protein plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway, which impacts cell division, differentiation, and secretion. Mutations in this gene, most frequently the V600E mutation, are the most commonly identified cancer-causing mutations in melanoma, and have been isolated in various other cancers as well, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer, thyroid carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, hairy cell leukemia and adenocarcinoma of the lung.  On June 27, 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved it and [Binimetinib] (BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI, Array BioPharma Inc.) in combination for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. it is an orally available Raf kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. it specifically inhibits Raf kinase, a serine/threonine enzyme in the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. By inhibiting the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, the administration of it may result in a decrease in proliferation of tumor cells. The Raf mutation BRAF V600E is frequently upregulated in a variety of human tumors and results in the constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that regulates cellular proliferation and survival.

Symptoms may include but are not limited to fatigue, gait changes, bowel or bladder dysfunction, abnormal muscle twitching, vision disturbance, and depressing or mood swings. MS is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and is found to occur more frequently in women than in men. "

It demonstrates a high genetic barrier against resistance mutations of the virus. In cell cultures, the emergence of amino acid substitutions at NS3 resistance-associated positions A156 or D/Q168 in HCV genotype 1a, 2a or 3a replicons led to reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir. The combinations of amino acid substitutions at NS3 position Y65H and D/Q168 also results in greater reductions in glecaprevir susceptibility, and NS3 Q80R in genotype 3a patients also leads to glecaprevir resistance.   it is available as an oral combination therapy with [DB13878] under the brand name Mavyret. This fixed-dose combination therapy was FDA-approved in August 2017 to treat adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1-6 without cirrhosis (liver disease) or with mild cirrhosis, including patients with moderate to severe kidney disease and those who are on dialysis. Mavyret is also indicated for HCV genotype 1-infected patients who have been previously treated with regimens either containing an NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. Hepatitis C viral infection often leads to decreased liver function and subsequent liver failure, causing a significantly negative impact on the patients' quality of life. The ultimate goal of the combination treatment is to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) and cure the patients from the infection.

        "caption": "it is a novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor used for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is associated with early relapse, poor clinical outcomes, and long-term survival. BTK is an enzyme that plays a role in oncogenic signalling pathways, where it promotes the survival and proliferation of malignant B cells. Compared to the first-generation BTK inhibitor [ibrutinib], it displays higher potency and selectivity for BTK with fewer off-target effects. Due to this enhanced selectivity towards BTK, it belongs to the second-generation BTK inhibitor drug group that also includes [acalabrutinib], which was approved by the FDA in 2017.  it was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in November 2019 based on clinical trial results that demonstrated an 84% overall response rate from it therapy in patients with MCL, which measures the proportion of patients in a trial whose tumour is entirely or partially destroyed by a drug. It is currently marketed under the trade name BRUKINSA\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 and is available as oral capsules. it is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, which leads to the inhibition of the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK. BTK, a member of the Src-related BTK/Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies; it plays an important role in B-lymphocyte development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival.

It is therefore useful in nuclear medicine, and is used in the labeling of leukocytes for localization of processes to which leukocytes migrate, such as those associated with abscesses or other infections. The degree of accuracy may vary with labeling techniques and with the size, location and nature of the inflammatory process.  Following intravenous administration, the lipid-soluble complex is able to penetrate platelet cell membranes. Once inside, Indium detaches from the oxyquinoline complexes and becomes attached to cytoplasmic components. "

Newer generations of DNA minor groove binding agents can more specifically recognize base pair sequences. it is a benzoyl mustard derivative of the antiviral agent distamycin A with potential antineoplastic activity. it selectively binds to A-T rich regions in the minor groove of DNA and alkylates at the N3 position of adenine in a highly sequence-specific manner. This prevents DNA replication, inhibits cellular proliferation and triggers apoptosis. Moreover, unlike other clinical nitrogen mustards, it does not carry out guanine-N7 alkylation in the major groove of DNA, which may lead to a high selectivity of action. "

It is a conjugate base of an it(1+). it is an orally bioavailable, hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blocker, with negative chronotropic activity. Upon administration, it selectively binds to the intracellular portion of the HCN channel pore and blocks HCN channels in the pacemaker cells within the sinoatrial (SA) node. This inhibits the If (funny) pacemaker ion current, prevents the inward flow and intracellular accumulation of positively charged ions, reduces pacemaker activity and slows diastolic depolarization. This decreases heart rate, reduces myocardial oxygen demand and allows more time for blood to flow to the myocardium without affecting cardiac contractility. HCN channels, mixed sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) channels that carry the inward If current, play a key role in the regulation of pacemaker firing rate in the SA node. The If pacemaker current, the inward flow of positively charged Na+-K+ ions, initiates the spontaneous diastolic depolarization phase and modulating heart rate. "

Upon oral administration, linaclotide binds to and activates GC-C receptors located on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium. This increases the concentration of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). cGMP activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and stimulates the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen. This promotes sodium excretion into the lumen and results in increased intestinal fluid secretion. This ultimately accelerates GI transit of intestinal contents, improves bowel movement and relieves constipation.

Upon administration, ivabradine selectively binds to the intracellular portion of the HCN channel pore and blocks HCN channels in the pacemaker cells within the sinoatrial (SA) node. This inhibits the If (funny) pacemaker ion current, prevents the inward flow and intracellular accumulation of positively charged ions, reduces pacemaker activity and slows diastolic depolarization. This decreases heart rate, reduces myocardial oxygen demand and allows more time for blood to flow to the myocardium without affecting cardiac contractility. HCN channels, mixed sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) channels that carry the inward If current, play a key role in the regulation of pacemaker firing rate in the SA node. The If pacemaker current, the inward flow of positively charged Na+-K+ ions, initiates the spontaneous diastolic depolarization phase and modulating heart rate. "

Upon administration, dubermatinib targets and binds to AXL and prevents its activity. This blocks AXL-mediated signal transduction pathways and inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which, in turn, inhibits tumor cell proliferation and migration. In addition, it enhances chemo-sensitivity to certain other chemotherapeutic agents. AXL, a member of the Tyro3, AXL and Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases and overexpressed by many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis; its expression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis.

Upon administration, it targets and binds to IDO1, a cytosolic enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the essential amino acid tryptophan into kynurenine. By inhibiting IDO1 and decreasing kynurenine in tumor cells, this agent increases tryptophan levels, restores the proliferation and activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, and T-lymphocytes, and causes a reduction in tumor-associated regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Activation of the immune system, which is suppressed in many cancers, may induce a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the IDO1-expressing tumor cells.

It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an anti-arrhythmia drug, a beta-adrenergic antagonist and an antiglaucoma drug. It contains a (S)-timolol (anhydrous). Timolol is a propanolamine derivative and a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist with antihypertensive property. Timolol competitively binds to beta-1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and beta-2-receptors in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, resulting in a decrease in beta-adrenergic stimulation. Beta-1-receptor blockade results in a decrease in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and, possibly, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension. Beta-2-blockade results in an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. The ultimate results include vasodilation, and negative chronotropic and inotropic cardiac effects. In addition, timolol reduces intra-ocular pressure possibly by decreasing aqueous humor production by reduction of blood flow to the ciliary processes and cAMP synthesis. "

As of October 31, 2017 the FDA approved Astra Zeneca's orally administered it (it). This Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and in adult patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who have already received at least one prior therapy.  Also known as it, it is also considered a second generation BTK inhibitor because it was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, theoretically expected to demonstrate fewer adverse effects owing to minimized bystander effects on targets other than BTK.  Nevertheless, it was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, which is based upon overall response rate and faciliates earlier approval of medicines that treat serious conditions or/and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Continued approval for it's currently accepted indication may subsequently be contingent upon ongoing verification and description of clinical benefit in confimatory trials.  Furthermore, the FDA granted this medication Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. It also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. At this time, more than 35 clinical trials across 40 countries with more than 2500 patients are underway or have been completed with regards to further research into better understanding and expanding the therapeutic uses of it. it is an orally available inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, it inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways. This leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B cells that overexpress BTK. BTK, a member of the src-related BTK/Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies; it plays an important role in B lymphocyte development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival.

Dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is often found in solid tumors and results in the promotion of tumor cell growth, survival, and resistance to chemo- and radio-therapy.

The etiology of the disease is mostly unknown; however, the role of JAK as a driver of immune-mediated conditions was discovered, leading to the use of JAK as therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis. To reduce dose-related toxicity (as seen with some pan-JAK inhibitors) without significantly affecting efficacy, more selective JAK1 inhibitors, it and [filgotinib], were developed.  The FDA approved it in August 2019 for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. In December 2019, it was additionally approved by the European Commission for the same indication in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to one or more DMARDs and can be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. it is marketed under the brand name RINVOQ\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 for oral administration. It is currently being investigated in several clinical trials assessing its therapeutic effectiveness in other inflammatory diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and atopic dermatitis.

Folic acid is a drug which is used for treatment of folic acid deficiency, megaloblastic anemia and in anemias of nutritional supplements, pregnancy, infancy, or childhood. Folic acid exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Folic acid has been found in human brain, kidney and liver tissues, and has also been primarily detected in feces, urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Folic acid exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. Folic acid participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Folic acid can be biosynthesized from dihydrofolic acid; which is catalyzed by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. In addition, Folic acid can be converted into folic acid; which is mediated by the enzyme proton-coupled folate transporter. In humans, folic acid is involved in pterine biosynthesis pathway, the folate malabsorption, hereditary pathway, the folate metabolism pathway, and the methotrexate action pathway. Folic acid is also involved in the metabolic disorder called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (MTHFRD). Folic acid is a potentially toxic compound. Folic acid has been found to be associated with several diseases known as alzheimer's disease, hereditary folate malabsorption, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency, and rheumatoid arthritis; folic acid has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorders including folate deficiency.

As an orally bioavailable drug therapy, it provides a novel treatment option for patients in whom removal of the causative tumor is not an option or for whom previous pituitary surgery has not been curative.  it is manufactured by Novartis under the brand name Isturisa. It has undergone phase II clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumours, hypertension, and heart failure, but development for these indications was discontinued by Novartis in January 2013. it was approved for use in the EU in January 2020 for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome (i.e. Cushing's disease), and was granted FDA approval and Orphan Drug designation in the US in March 2020 for the same indication. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of both steroid 11beta-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 11B1) and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2; steroid 18-hydroxylase), with potential anti-adrenal activity and ability to treat Cushing disease (CD). Upon administration, it binds to and inhibits the activity of CYP11B1, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of cortisol synthesis from the precursor 11-deoxycortisol, and CYP11B2, the enzyme that catalyzes aldosterone synthesis from corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone in the adrenal gland.

More specifically, it is a peptidomimetic growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) that acts as an agonist of GH secretagogue receptor, or ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) to dose-dependently increase GH levels. Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) represent a new class of pharmacological agents which have the potential to be used in numerous clinical applications. They include treatment for growth retardation in children and cachexia associated with chronic disease such as AIDS and cancer.   Growth hormone (GH) is classically linked with linear growth during childhood. In deficiency of this hormone, AGHD is commonly associated with increased fat mass (particularly in the abdominal region), decreased lean body mass, osteopenia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and/or glucose intolerance overtime. In addition, individuals with may be susceptible to cardiovascular complications from altered structures and function. Risk factors of AGHD include a history of childhood-onset GH deficiency or with hypothalamic/pituitary disease, surgery, or irradiation to these areas, head trauma, or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies. While there are various therapies available such as GH replacement therapy, the absence of panhypopituitarism and low serum IGF-I levels with nonspecific clinical symptoms pose challenges to the detection and diagnosis of AGHD. The diagnosis of AGHD requires biochemical confirmation with at least 1 GH stimulation test. it is clinically useful since it displays good stability and oral bioavailability with comparable affinity to ghrelin receptor as its endogenous ligand. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects, it stimulated GH release in a dose-dependent manner with good tolerability.  it, developed by Aeterna Zentaris, was approved by the FDA in December 2017 under the market name Macrilen for oral solution. it is an orally available synthetic mimetic of the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue ghrelin with potential anti-cachexia activity. Upon oral administration, it mimics endogenous ghrelin by stimulating appetite and binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor GHSR in the central nervous system, thereby mimicking the GH-releasing effects of ghrelin from the pituitary gland. Stimulation of GH secretion increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels which may further stimulate protein synthesis. In addition, ghrelin reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may play a direct role in cancer-related loss of appetite. "

In cell cultures, the emergence of amino acid substitutions at known NS5A inhibitor resistance-associated positions in HCV genotype 1a, 2a or 3a replicons led to reduced susceptibility and resistance to it. These resistance-associated amino acid substitutions included Q30D/deletion, Y93D/H/N or H58D +Y93H in genotype 1a replicons, F28S + M31I or P29S + K30G in genotype 2a replicons, and Y93H in genotype 3a replicons.

This fixed-dose combination therapy was FDA-approved in August 2017 to treat adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1-6 without cirrhosis (liver disease) or with mild cirrhosis, including patients with moderate to severe kidney disease and those who are on dialysis. Mavyret is also indicated for HCV genotype 1-infected patients who have been previously treated with regimens either containing an NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. Hepatitis C viral infection often leads to decreased liver function and subsequent liver failure, causing a significantly negative impact on the patients' quality of life.

PARPs are enzymes activated by single-strand DNA breaks that catalyze the post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, which induces signaling and the recruitment of other proteins to repair damaged DNA. The PARP-mediated repair pathway plays a key role in DNA repair and is dysregulated in a variety of cancer cell types. "

Since it has multiple therapeutic activities there are several proposed mechanisms of action for this agent. The anti-inflammatory effects of this agent appear to be related to the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages. This agent may activate the NO/cyclic GMP pathway and inhibit both the phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLC gamma2)/protein kinase C (PKC) and PI3K/AKT-MAPK signaling pathways in activated platelets to inhibit platelet aggregation. In activated platelets, these three signaling pathways are downstream of integrin activation mediated by collagen binding and influence the association of fibrinogen with its receptors. Additionally, it may exert its anti-cancer activity through the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and the stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation and activation. These processes could result in decreased proliferation of and increased immunocytotoxicity against tumor cells. "

Upon oral administration, it specifically binds to and inhibits the activity of Syk, JAK1, and JAK3 with preferential inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3-dependent cytokine-mediated signaling and functional responses. This negatively affects the downstream JAK-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway, and leads to both reduced inflammation in various animal models and enhanced antiproliferative activity towards non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell lines. Syk is a non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in signal transduction in cells of hematopoietic origin including B cells, macrophages, basophils and neutrophils. Abnormal function of Syk has been implicated in several hematopoietic malignancies including NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The JAK-STAT pathway plays a key role in the signaling of many cytokines and growth factors and is involved in cellular proliferation, growth, hematopoiesis, and the immune response; JAK kinases may be upregulated in inflammatory diseases, myeloproliferative disorders, and various malignancies.

Upon administration, IBD exerts its potential anti-tumor activity against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells by inhibiting PDE-4 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which results in a decrease in MIF, its receptor CD74, and AKT expression, and attenuates the immunosuppressive properties of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and reduces T-regulatory cells (Tregs). This causes GBM cell apoptosis and inhibits GBM cell proliferation. In addition, IBD reduces, through its inhibitory effect on various PDEs, the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL- 1beta, leukotriene B4, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). IBD also upregulates the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and promotes the production of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4).

This binding results in the ubiquitination and rapid proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros and the derepression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes, including DDX58 and IRF7, leading to apoptosis of certain tumor cells. Additionally, Aiolos degredation leads to derepression of the IL2 gene, thereby enhancing interleukin-2 production, costimulation of T-lymphocytes and IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation. it may also promote the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, potentially enhancing tumor cell killing. Aiolos and Ikaros are transcriptional repressors known to play an important role in normal B- and T-cell function. "

It works by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases that activate signalling pathways in tumour cells. FGFRs gained attention as potential therapeutic targets in selected cancers, as FGFR gene alterations were observed in a wide variety of cancers including those of the urinary bladder, breast, ovary, prostate, endometrium, lung, and stomach. Deregulated FGFR signalling pathway can lead the development of oncogenes and tumour-promoting physiological processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, enhanced angiogenesis, and evasion of cell death.  In April 2020, it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in previously treated adult patients with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene fusion or other rearrangements as detected by an FDA-approved test. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common primary malignancy affecting the biliary tract and the second most common primary hepatic malignancy. This malignancy accounts for 15% to 20% of primary hepatobiliary malignancies, which account for 13% of overall cancer-related global mortality. With increasing research on the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma and potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drug treatment, recent studies show that up to 45% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma exhibited gene rearrangements resulting in oncogenic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins. The FDA-approved indication for it was granted under accelerated approval based on the overall response rate and duration of response in pre-marketing clinical trials. it is marketed under the brand name Pemazyre, and it is available as oral tablets. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) types 1, 2, and 3 (FGFR1/2/3), with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and inhibits FGFR1/2/3, which may result in the inhibition of FGFR1/2/3-related signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation in FGFR1/2/3-overexpressing tumor cells. FGFR, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases upregulated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in cellular proliferation, migration, and survival. "

Considering urothelial cancer is statistically the fourth most common kind of cancer in the world, the introduction of it offers a welcome new option in the ever-expanding therapeutic tool kit to treat such prevalent medical conditions.  Nevertheless, although it was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and Accelerated Approval from the FDA so as to allow the agency to focus on and expedite the approval process for a medication indicated for a serious condition that fills an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is believed to predict a genuine clinical benefit for patients with the given condition, such designations mean further ongoing clinical trials are necessary to confirm the clinical benefit of it going forward. it is an orally bioavailable, pan fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity.

Upon administration of it, this agent selectively binds to and inhibits the binding of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prevents the activation of the EP4 receptor. This inhibits PGE2-EP4 receptor-mediated signaling and prevents proliferation in tumor cells in which the PGE2-EP4 signaling pathway is over-activated. In addition, EP4 receptor inhibition modulates the immune system by preventing both interleukin-23 (IL-23) production and the IL-23-mediated expansion of Th17 cells. As EP4 is expressed by peripheral sensory neurons, blockade of EP4-mediated signaling may induce an analgesic effect.

It is an aromatic amine, a member of indazoles and a member of phenylureas. it is an orally bioavailable receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. it inhibits members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor families; it exhibits much less activity against unrelated RTKs, soluble tyrosine kinases, or serine/threonine kinases. This agent does not have a general antiproliferative effect due to its high dose requirement. However, it may exhibit potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on tumor cells whose proliferation is dependent on mutant kinases, such as FMS-related tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3). "

Inhibition of WEE1 activity prevents the phosphorylation of CDC2 and impairs the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. This may lead to apoptosis upon treatment with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53 deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells.
