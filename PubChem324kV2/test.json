In plasma, indoxyl sulfate is a protein-bound uremic solute that induces endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting endothelial proliferation and migration in vitro. Some studies suggest that indoxyl sulfate is also involved in oxidative stress. In hemodialyzed patients, serum levels of indoxyl sulfate are associated with levels of pentosidine, a marker of carbonyl and oxidative stress; in vitro, indoxyl sulfate increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in tubular cells, and increases NAD(P)H oxidase activity in endothelial cells. Indoxyl sulfate impairs osteoblst function and induces abnormalities of bone turnover. Indoxyl sulfate strongly decreases the levels of glutathione, one of the most active antioxidant systems of the cell.

Upon administration, the peptide ligand moiety of nendratareotide uzatansine targets and binds to SSTR2, which is overexpressed on certain tumor cell types. Binding stimulates SSTR2-mediated endocytosis of the agent; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics. This inhibits both cell division and the proliferation of SSTR2-expressing cancer cells.

    "caption": "The molecule is an oral, direct acting hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor that is no longer available but was previously used in combination with other antiviral agents in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, genotypes 1 and 4, but subsequently was withdrawn. Simeprevir has been linked to isolated, rare instances of mild, acute liver injury during treatment and to occasional cases of hepatic decompensation in patients with preexisting cirrhosis.\nThe molecule is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor indicated in patient's with HCV genotype 1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug, [DB08934]. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication, the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-\u03b1 and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b.   According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-na\u00efve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality.  Simeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-na\u00efve patients with cirrhosis.  Simeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-na\u00efve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients."

It has been proposed that by interacting with the ETC, idebenone increases ATP production required for mitochondrial function, reduces free radicals, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and consequently protects the lipid membrane and mitochondria from oxidative damage. More specifically, idebenone is thought to transfer electrons directly to complex III of the mitochondrial ETC, thereby circumventing complex I and restoring cellular energy (ATP) generation.   Due to its ability to reduce oxidative damage and improve ATP production, idebenone was originally investigated for its potential use in Alzheimer's Disease and other cognitivie disorders. Lack of improvement in cognitive function halted its production for these conditions, however it continues to be investigated for use in other conditions associated with mitochondrial damage.   Idebenone is currently only indicated for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with Leber\u2019s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). LHON is a mitochondrially inherited degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in acute central vision loss. Due to its biochemical mode of action, it's thought that idebenone may re-activate viable-but-inactive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in LHON patients. It is not currently approved for use by either the Food and Drug Administration (USA) or Health Canada."

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase.

Used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. It has a role as a CFTR potentiator and an orphan drug. It is a quinolone, a member of phenols, an aromatic amide and a monocarboxylic acid amide.\nThe molecule is a drug used for the management of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). It is manufactured and distributed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on January 31, 2012, and by Health Canada in late 2012.  Ivacaftor is administered as a monotherapy and also administered in combination with other drugs for the management of CF.  Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes. CFTR is active in epithelial cells of organs such as of the lungs, pancreas, liver, digestive system, and reproductive tract. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes. As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to complications such as infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.  Prior to the development of ivacaftor, management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process or lung function (FEV1). Notably, ivacaftor was the first medication approved for the management of the underlying causes of CF (abnormalities in CFTR protein function) rather than control of symptoms."

    "caption": "The molecule is an acetate ester that is uracil in which the three hydroxy hydrogens are replaced by acetate group. A prodrug for uridine, it is used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria and for management of fluorouracil toxicity. It has a role as a prodrug, a neuroprotective agent and an orphan drug. It is a member of uridines and an acetate ester.\nThe molecule is an orally active prodrug of the naturally occurring nucleoside uridine. It is used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria (Xuriden), or for the emergency treatment of fluorouracil or capecitabine overdose or toxicity (Vistogard).  It is provided in the prodrug form as uridine triacetate as this form delivers 4- to 6-fold more uridine into the systemic circulation compared to equimolar doses of uridine itself.   When used for the treatment or prevention of toxicity associated with fluorouracil and other antimetabolites, uridine triacetate is utilized for its ability to compete with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolites for incorporation into the genetic material of non-cancerous cells. It reduces toxicity and cell-death associated with two cytotoxic intermediates: 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). Normally, FdUMP inhibits thymidylate synthase required for thymidine synthesis and DNA replication and repair while FUTP incorporates into RNA resulting in defective strands. As a result, these metabolites are associated with various unpleasant side effects such as neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea, and hand\u2013foot syndrome. Like many other neoplastic agents, these side effects limit the doses of 5-FU that can be administered, which also affects the efficacy for treatment. By pre-administering with uridine (as the prodrug uridine triacetate), higher doses of 5-FU can be given allowing for improved efficacy and a reduction in toxic side effects. It can also be used as a rescue therapy if severe side effects present within 96 hours after initiation of therapy.   Uridine triacetate is also used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria, also known as uridine monophosphate synthase deficiency. This rare congenital autosomal recessive disorder of pyrimidine metabolism is caused by a defect in uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS), a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. As a result of UMPS deficiency, patients experience a  systemic deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides, accounting for most symptoms of the disease. Additionally, orotic acid from the de novo pyrimidine pathway that cannot be converted to UMP is excreted in the urine, accounting for the common name of the disorder, orotic aciduria. Furthermore, orotic acid crystals in the urine can cause episodes of obstructive uropathy. When administered as the prodrug uridine triacetate, uridine can be used by essentially all cells to make uridine nucleotides, which compensates for the genetic deficiency in synthesis in patients with hereditary orotic aciduria. When intracellular uridine nucleotides are restored into the normal range, overproduction of orotic acid is reduced by feedback inhibition, so that urinary excretion of orotic acid is also reduced.\nThe molecule is a synthetic uridine pro-drug that is converted to uridine in vivo. Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleotide, has been used in a variety of diseases including depressive disorders and inherited myopathies. (NCI04)"

Once used in a wide variety of applications, including preserving wood and anatomical specimens, embalming and disinfecting, as an intensifier in photography, as a mordant for rabbit and beaver furs, and freeing gold from lead, its use has markedly declined as less toxic alternatives have been developed. It has a role as a sensitiser.\nThe molecule is a highly toxic compound that volatizes slightly at ordinary temperature and appreciably at 100 degrees C. It is corrosive to mucous membranes and used as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant. Mercuric chloride was used to disinfect wounds by Arab physicians in the Middle Ages but modern medicine has since deemed it unsafe for use.\nThe molecule is one of the most toxic chemical compounds of mercury, due to its high solubility in water. It is most often used as a laboratory reagent, and occasionally used to form amalgams with metals.\nThe molecule is corrosive to mucous membranes and used as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant."

MET is a desirable target in the treatment of certain solid tumors as it appears to play a critical role, both directly and indirectly, in the growth and proliferation of tumors in which it is overexpressed and/or mutated.  Tepotinib was first approved in Japan in March 2020 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with MET alterations, and was subsequently granted accelerated approval by the US FDA in February 2021, under the brand name Tepmetko, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC and MET exon 14 skipping alterations. It is the first oral MET-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor to allow for once-daily dosing, an advantage that may aid in easing the pill burden often associated with chemotherapeutic regimens.

They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. (L795)"

It is functionally related to a benzamide.\nThe molecule is hypertension. Characterized by an office blood pressure of \u2265140/90, hypertension is pervasive and impacts an estimated 25% of adults globally. Treatment for hypertension should include a number of lifestyle changes (ie. reduced sodium intake) along with pharmacotherapy - it should be noted that treatment with several antihypertensive agents may be required in order to achieve blood pressure targets.  Thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are a valuable tool for the treatment of hypertension and continue to grow in popularity, falling behind only ACE inhibitors in terms of prescription frequency. When compared to [hydrochlorothiazide] (another commonly prescribed diuretic), indapamide has been shown to be superior at lowering systolic blood pressure, reducing left ventricular mass index, lowering oxidative stress, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and reducing microalbuminuria associated with diabetes. Interestingly, unlike thiazide diuretics, several sources suggest that indapamide is not associated with glucose or lipid disturbances.   Indapamide is characterized by both a methylindoline and a sulfamoyl chlorobenzamide functional group, with the former being largely responsible for the molecule\u2019s lipid solubility.\nThe molecule is a Thiazide-like Diuretic. The physiologic effect of indapamide is by means of Increased Diuresis.\nThe molecule is an indole derivative of chlorosulphonamide and a sulfamyl diuretic with antihypertensive activity. Indapamide may interact directly with the subunits of delayed rectifier potassium channels, thereby blocking both slow and rapid K+ (IKs and IKr) currents through the channels. Through the homeostasis mechanism in balancing total ion concentration (Ca++, Na+), it reduces vascular hyperreactivity and peripheral and arterial vascular resistance, possibly by inhibiting transmembrane ionic influx, probably calcium ions, and stimulating prostaglandin E2 synthesis, thereby causing vasodilatation. Indapamide exerts its diuretic effect by inhibiting reabsorption of sodium and chloride, primarily as a result of action on the cortical diluting segment of the renal distal tubule, thereby promoting urinary excretion of water and electrolytes.\nA benzamide-sulfonamide-indole derived DIURETIC that functions by inhibiting SODIUM CHLORIDE SYMPORTERS."

In the sesquihydrate form. pH (saturated aqueous solution) about 5.0. (NTP, 1992)\nThe molecule is a derivative of L-tyrosine having a methyl group at the alpha-position and an additional hydroxy group at the 3-position on the phenyl ring. It has a role as a hapten, an antihypertensive agent, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a peripheral nervous system drug and a sympatholytic agent. It is a L-tyrosine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid.\nThe molecule is a centrally acting sympatholytic agent and an antihypertensive agent. It is an analog of DOPA (3,4\u2010hydroxyphenylanine), and it is a prodrug, meaning that the drug requires biotransformation to an active metabolite for therapeutic effects. Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(\u03b1)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals. Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-\u03b1-methyldopa and L-\u03b1-methyldopa, which is the active form.  First introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent, methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents; however, it is still used as monotherapy or in combination with [hydrochlorothiazide]. Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.\nThe molecule is a Central alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonist. The mechanism of action of methyldopa anhydrous is as an Adrenergic alpha2-Agonist.\nThe molecule is a centrally active sympatholytic agent that has been used for more than 50 years for the treatment of hypertension. Methyldopa has been clearly linked to instances of acute and chronic liver injury that can be severe and even fatal.\nThe molecule is a centrally-acting adrenergic antihypertensive medication. Its use is now deprecated following introduction of alternative safer classes of agents. However it continues to have a role in otherwise difficult to treat hypertension and gestational hypertension (formerly known as pregnancy-induced hypertension). Methyldopa is an aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase inhibitor in animals and in man. Only methyldopa, the <i>L</i>-isomer of alpha-methyldopa, has the ability to inhibit dopa decarboxylase and to deplete animal tissues of norepinephrine. In man the antihypertensive activity appears to be due solely to the L-isomer. About twice the dose of the racemate (DL-alpha-methyldopa) is required for equal antihypertensive effect. Methyldopa has no direct effect on cardiac function and usually does not reduce glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. Cardiac output usually is maintained without cardiac acceleration. In some patients the heart rate is slowed. Normal or elevated plasma renin activity may decrease in the course of methyldopa therapy. Methyldopa reduces both supine and standing blood pressure. Methyldopa usually produces highly effective lowering of the supine pressure with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension. Exercise hypotension and diurnal blood pressure variations rarely occur. Methyldopa, in its active metabolite form, is a central alpha-2 receptor agonist. Using methyldopa leads to alpha-2 receptor-negative feedback to sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (centrally and peripherally), allowing peripheral sympathetic nervous system tone to decrease. Such activity leads to a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cardiac output. When introduced it was a mainstay of antihypertensive therapy, but its use has declined, with increased use of other safer classes of agents. One of its important present-day uses is in the management of pregnancy-induced hypertension, as it is relatively safe in pregnancy compared to other antihypertensive drugs (Wikipedia).\nThe molecule is as an antihypertensive agent."

It was marketed as Gemonil by Abbott Laboratories. It is a barbiturate anticonvulsant, used in the treatment of epilepsy. It has similar properties to phenobarbital. Metharbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission."

It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nimodipine prevents calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. Compared to other calcium channel blocking agents, nimodipine exhibits greater effects on cerebral circulation than on peripheral circulation. Nimodipine is used to as an adjunct to improve the neurologic outcome following subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured intracranial aneurysm.\nThe molecule is a Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker. The mechanism of action of nimodipine is as a Calcium Channel Antagonist.\nThe molecule is a second generation calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine is not widely used and has not been implicated in causing clinically apparent acute liver injury.\nThe molecule is a dihydropyridine derivative and an analogue of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, with antihypertensive activity. Nimodipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions in response to depolarization in smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and inducing vasodilatation. Nimodipine has a greater effect on cerebral arteries than on peripheral smooth muscle cells and myocardial cells, probably because this agent can cross the blood brain barrier due to its lipophilic nature. Furthermore, this agent also inhibits the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein, which is overexpressed in some multi-drug resistant tumors, and may improve the efficacy of some antineoplastic agents.\nA calcium channel blockader with preferential cerebrovascular activity.

Quazepam and its major metabolite 2-oxoquazepam potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by binding to the benzodiazepine-1 recognition site (BZ-1) within the GABA-A receptor, located in the limbic, neocortical and mesencephalic reticular system. This increases the frequency of GABA-activated chloride channel opening events, allowing the flow of chloride ions into the neuron leading to membrane hyperpolarization and decreased neuronal excitability.\nThe molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It induces impairment of motor function and has hypnotic properties. Quazepam is used to treat insomnia.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors, which affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."

    "caption": "Safrole appears as clear colorless or slightly yellow liquid with the odor of sassafras. Denser than water (density 1.09 g / cm3) and insoluble in water. Hence sinks in water. Obtained from oil of sassafras or oil of camphor.\nThe molecule is a member of the class of benzodioxoles that is 1,3-benzodioxole which is substituted by an allyl group at position 5. It is found in several plants, including black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg, and is present in several essential oils, notably that of sassafras. It has insecticidal properties and has been used as a topical antiseptic. Although not thought to pose a significant carcinogenic risk to humans, findings of weak carcinogenicity in rats have resulted in the banning of its (previously widespread) use in perfumes and soaps, and as a food additive. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a flavouring agent, an insecticide and a metabolite.\nThe molecule is a natural product found in Elettaria cardamomum, Curcuma amada, and other organisms with data available.\nThe molecule is a naturally-occurring, colorless to slightly yellow liquid that is soluble in ethanol, ether, and chloroform. Safrole is no longer used in the United States. Minimal exposure to safrole may occur through the use of edible spices, including nutmeg and mace, which contain low levels of this compound. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)\nThe molecule is found in anise. Safrole occurs in nutmeg. Banned by FDA for use in food. Safrole is formerly used as a food flavour It is a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide and the recreational drug MDMA (Ecstacy). Safrole is a natural plant constituent, found in oil of sassafras and certain other essential oils. It is a member of the methylenedioxybenzene group of compounds, many of which (e.g. piperonyl butoxide) are extensively used as insecticide synergists. Safrole is a major source of human exposure to safrole is through consumption of spices, such as nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper, in which safrole is a constituent. Safrole is also present in root beer, and has been used as an additive in chewing gum, toothpaste, soaps and certain pharmaceutical preparations. Safrole is a weak hepatocarcinogen and it is a matter of considerable interest whether the ally1 moiety or the methylenedioxy group, or both, are involved in the mechanism of its carcinogenesis. Safrole is extensively metabolized, giving rise to a large number of metabolites. Metabolism involves essentially two major routes, oxidation of the ally1 side chain, and oxidation of the methylenedioxy group with subsequent cleavage to form the catechol. Safrole undergoes oxidation of the allylic group to yield the 2, 3-epoxide (safrole epoxide). The dihydrodiol is one of the metabolites of safrole, and presumably arises from the hydration of the 2, 3-epoxide. The principal route of metabolism of safrole is through cleavage of the methylenedioxy group, the major metabolites being allylcatechol and its isomer, propenylcatechol. Eugenol and its isomer I-methoxy- 2-hydroxy-4-allylbenzene have been detected as minor metabolites in the rat, mouse and man. ; Safrole, also known as shikimol, is a colorless or slightly yellow oily liquid. It is typically extracted from the root-bark or the fruit of sassafras plants in the form of sassafras oil, or synthesized from other related methylenedioxy compounds. It is the principal component of brown camphor oil, and is found in small amounts in a wide variety of plants, where it functions as a natural pesticide. The Ocotea cymbarum[verification needed] oil made of the Ocotea pretiosa[verification needed], a plant growing in Brazil, and sassafras oil made of Sassafras albidum, a tree growing in eastern North America, are the main natural sources for safrole. It has a characteristic candy-shop aroma. Safrole has been shown to exhibit antibiotic and anti-angiogenic functions  (A3314, A3315, A3316).\nThe molecule is a constituent of several VOLATILE OILS, notably SASSAFRAS oil. It is a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide PIPERONYL BUTOXIDE and the drug N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA)."

Resiniferatoxin (RTX) binds to and activates the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel in the plasma membrane of primary afferent sensory neurons. This increases the permeability to cations, and leads to an influx of calcium and sodium ions. This results in membrane depolarization, causing an irritant effect, followed by desensitization of the sensory neurons thereby inhibiting signal conduction in afferent pain pathways and causing analgesia.

It is a prodrug for salycylic acid that is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and also shows activity against type II diabetes. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, an antirheumatic drug, a hypoglycemic agent, an antineoplastic agent, an EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-lactamase) inhibitor and a prodrug. It is a benzoate ester, a member of benzoic acids, a member of phenols and a member of salicylates. It is functionally related to a salicylic acid.\nThe molecule is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. Salsalate's mode of action as an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agent may be due to inhibition of synthesis and release of prostaglandins. The usefulness of salicylic acid, the active in vivo product of salsalate, in the treatment of arthritic disorders has been established. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo. Salsalate is readily soluble in the small intestine where it is partially hydrolyzed to two molecules of salicylic acid. A significant portion of the parent compound is absorbed unchanged and undergoes rapid esterase hydrolysis in the body. The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours.\nThe molecule is a nonacetylated dimer of salicylic acid that is used in the treatment of chronic arthritis as an analgesic and antipyretic. Salsalate can cause moderate serum aminotransferase elevations when given in high doses in a manner similar to aspirin.\nThe molecule is an orally available salicylate and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities. As a prodrug, salsalate is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid which inhibits the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. This prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin precursors and leads to decreased formation of prostaglandins that are involved in pain, fever and inflammation. In addition, salsalate appears to inhibit nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), thereby preventing activation of the NF-kB-mediated pathway and the expression of genes involved in inflammation."

Topiramate has been rarely associated with hepatic injury and largely when used in combination with other anticonvulsant medications.\nThe molecule is a anti-epileptic drug used to manage seizures and prevent migraines. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1996. In 2004, topiramate was approved for the prevention of migraine in adults. Since 2012, the extended-release formulation has been approved in combination with [phentermine] for chronic weight management therapy in adults.   Characteristics that distinguish topiramate from other antiepileptic drugs are a monosaccharide chemical structure containing a sulfamate, and 40% of its mass accounted for by oxygen. Interestingly, topiramate was discovered by chance when attempts were made to formulate a novel antidiabetic drug.\nThe molecule is an anticonvulsant drug used to treat epilepsy in both children and adults. In children it is also indicated for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (a disorder that causes seizures and developmental delays). It is also Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and now most frequently prescribed for, the prevention of migraines. It has been used by psychiatrists to treat bipolar disorder, although it is not FDA approved for this purpose and such use is somewhat controversial. This drug has been investigated for use in treatment of obesity, especially to aid in the reduction of binge eating, and also as a possible treatment for alcoholism. However, these uses are not actively promoted by the manufacturer, and like its use for bipolar disorder, are 'off-label' uses. The drug is also used in clinical trials to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. A pilot study suggests that Topiramate is possibly effective against infantile spasm; Chemically, topiramate is a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide, related to fructose, a rather unusual chemical structure for an anticonvulsant. Topiramate is quickly absorbed after oral use. Most of the drug (70%) is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. The remainder is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. Topiramate enhances GABA-activated chloride channels. In addition, topiramate inhibits excitatory neurotransmission, through actions on kainate and AMPA receptors. There is evidence that topiramate has a specific effect on GluR5 kainate receptors. It is also an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, particularly subtypes II and IV, but this action is weak and unlikely to be related to its anticonvulsant actions, but may account for the bad taste and the development of renal stones seen during treatment. Its possible effect as a mood stabilizer seems to occur before anticonvulsant qualities at lower dosages. Topiramate inhibits maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures as well as partial and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the kindling model, findings predictive of a broad spectrum of antiseizure activities clinically; Johnson.

    "caption": "The molecule is a naturally occurring element widely distributed in the earth's crust. In the environment, arsenic is combined with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur to form inorganic arsenic compounds. Arsenic in animals and plants combines with carbon and hydrogen to form organic arsenic compounds. Inorganic arsenic compounds are mainly used to preserve wood. Copper chromated arsenic (CCA) is used to make \"pressure-treated\" lumber. CCA is no longer used in the U.S. for residential uses; it is still used in industrial applications. Organic arsenic compounds are used as pesticides, primarily on cotton plants.\nThe molecule is a nonessential trace element that is widely distributed in nature. Arsenic was used in medicinal agents in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but has been replaced by safer and more effective agents and has not been in use for over 50 years. Nevertheless, arsenic is found widely in nature and accidental or intentional acute or chronic exposures to moderate or high levels of arsenic can cause liver injury, sometimes presenting long after the exposure.\nArsenic appears as a grayish metallic solid that turns black upon exposure to air. Insoluble in water. Toxic by ingestion.\nThe molecule is a pnictogen and a metalloid atom. It has a role as a micronutrient.\nThe molecule is found throughout the environment. For most people, exposure to arsenic, including to inorganic arsenic compounds, occurs through their diet. Acute (short-term), high-level inhalation exposure to inorganic arsenic has resulted in respiratory effects (cough, dyspnea, chest pain), gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain), and central and peripheral nervous system effects. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to inorganic arsenic in humans is associated with skin, cardiovascular, and neurological effects. Acute oral exposure to inorganic arsenic has resulted in effects on the digestive tract, respiratory tract, central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular system, liver, and blood and has resulted in death. Chronic oral exposure to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic has resulted in gastrointestinal effects, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, skin lesions, hyperpigmentation, and liver and kidney damage in humans. EPA has concluded that inorganic arsenic is a human carcinogen. Evidence from human studies suggests that exposure to inorganic arsenic by inhalation may result in lung cancer, while exposure by ingestion may result in nonmelanoma skin cancer and bladder, kidney, liver, and lung cancers."

As with most benzodiazepines, triazolam therapy has not been associated with serum aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase elevations, and clinically apparent liver injury from triazolam has been reported but is very rare.\nThe molecule is a triazolobenzodiazepinederivative with sedative-hypnotic property. Triazolam interacts directly with a specific site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A-chloride-ionophore receptor complex located on the neuronal membrane. Binding causes allosteric modification of the receptor and modulation of its affinity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. This results in enhancement of synaptic actions of GABA and includes an increase in the frequency of chloride channel openings, increased chloride ion conductance, membrane hyperpolarization and ultimately synaptic inhibition and decreased neuronal excitability.\nThe molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is withdrawn in the United Kingdom due to risk of psychiatric adverse drug reactions. This drug continues to be available in the U.S. Internationally, triazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to bezodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell.\nA short-acting benzodiazepine used in the treatment of insomnia. Some countries temporarily withdrew triazolam from the market because of concerns about adverse reactions, mostly psychological, associated with higher dose ranges. Its use at lower doses with appropriate care and labeling has been reaffirmed by the FDA and most other countries."

A metabolic precursor to aspartate, Asparagine is a nontoxic carrier of residual ammonia to be eliminated from the body. Asparagine acts as diuretic. (NCI04)\nThe molecule is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids on Earth. It has carboxamide as the side chain's functional group. It is considered a non-essential amino acid. Asparagine is not an essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is converted to aspartate using a transaminase enzyme. The enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. In the asparagine synthetase reaction, ATP is used to activate aspartate, forming beta-aspartyl-AMP. glutamine donates an ammonium group which reacts with beta-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP. Since the asparagine side chain can make efficient hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagines are often found near the beginning and end of alpha-helices, and in turn motifs in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as capping the hydrogen bond interactions which would otherwise need to be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone. glutamines have an extra methylene group, have more conformational entropy and thus are less useful in this regard. Asparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, modification of the protein chain with the addition of carbohydrate chains. A reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars or reactive carbonyls produces acrylamide (acrylic amide) in food when heated to sufficient temperature, i.e. baking. These occur primarily in baked goods such as french fries, potato chips, and roasted coffee. Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant--hence its name--becoming the first amino acid to be isolated. The smell observed in the urine of some individuals after their consumption of asparagus is attributed to a byproduct of the metabolic breakdown of asparagine, asparagine-amino-succinic-acid monoamide. (However, some scientists disagree and implicate other substances in the smell, especially methanethiol).

It is highly effective for the treatment of opioid use disorder and is also increasingly being used in the treatment of chronic pain. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, a delta-opioid receptor antagonist and a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist.\nThe molecule is a weak partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and a weak kappa-opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of severe pain. It is also commonly used as an alternative to [methadone] for the treatment of severe opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously. Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.  Buprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids. For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over [methadone] (which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation, fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects, and an improved safety profile with a lower risk of overdose and respiratory depression.  Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone]. This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the \"ceiling effect\" where once a certain dose is reached, buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids. It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.  Treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine, [methadone], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as [heroin] or [fentanyl]. Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.\nThe molecule is a Partial Opioid Agonist. The mechanism of action of buprenorphine is as a Partial Opioid Agonist.\nThe molecule is a sublingually and transdermally available, semisynthetic opioid analgesic, which is used as an analgesic and for management of opioid dependence. Therapy with buprenorphine is associated with mild and transient serum enzyme elevations, and with moderate-to-severe clinically apparent liver injury when abused by intravenous administration or the sublingual formations.\nThe molecule is a natural product found in Papaver somniferum and Apis cerana with data available.\nThe molecule is a more potent and longer lasting analgesic than MORPHINE. It appears to act as a partial agonist at mu and kappa opioid receptors and as an antagonist at delta receptors. The lack of delta-agonist activity has been suggested to account for the observation that buprenorphine tolerance may not develop with chronic use."

Propylthiouracil has been linked to serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy as well as to a clinically apparent, idiosyncratic liver injury that can be severe and even fatal.\nThe molecule is a thiourea derivative with antithyroid property. Propylthiouracil (PTU) interferes with the oxidation of iodine possibly by interaction with peroxidase or a peroxidase-mediated complex reaction, thereby inhibiting synthesis of thyroid hormones tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). In addition, this agent inhibits the Type I 5'-deiodinase (D1), an enzyme involved in the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to tri-iodothyronine. This results in decreased plasma triodothyronine concentrations and decreased entrance of thyroxine into cells thereby reducing thyroid hormone activity.\nThe molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a thiourea antithyroid agent. Propythiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine and inhibits the peripheral conversion of throxine to tri-iodothyronine. It is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Propylthiouracil binds to thyroid peroxidase and thereby inhibits the conversion of iodide to iodine. Thyroid peroxidase normally converts iodide to iodine (via hydrogen peroxide as a cofactor) and also catalyzes the incorporation of the resulting iodide molecule onto both the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosines found in thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is degraded to produce thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Therefore propylthiouracil effectively inhibits the production of new thyroid hormones.\nThe molecule is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as ledipasvir. More specifically, ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-Structural Protein 5A (NS5A), which is required for viral RNA replication and assembly of HCV virions. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is postulated to prevent hyperphosphorylation of NS5A which is required for viral protein production. It is effective against genotypes 1a, 1b, 4a, and 5a and with a lesser activity against genotypes 2a and 3a of HCV. Ledipasvir and other direct acting antivirals are very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.    In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend ledipasvir as a first line therapy option in combination with [sofosbuvir] for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 4, 5, and 6. Treatment with ledipasvir is used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as ledipasvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects.   Since 2014, ledipasvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [sofosbuvir] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [ribavirin] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis. When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV."

Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. (L795)"

Upon oral administration, linaclotide binds to and activates GC-C receptors located on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium. This increases the concentration of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). cGMP activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and stimulates the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen. This promotes sodium excretion into the lumen and results in increased intestinal fluid secretion. This ultimately accelerates GI transit of intestinal contents, improves bowel movement and relieves constipation. Increased extracellular cGMP levels may also exert an antinociceptive effect, through an as of yet not fully elucidated mechanism, that may involve modulation of nociceptors found on colonic afferent pain fibers. Linaclotide is minimally absorbed from the GI tract."

It contains a theophylline and an ethylenediamine.\nThe molecule is a drug combination that contains theophylline and ethylenediamine in a 2:1 ratio. Once in the body, theophylline is released and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Similar to other theophyllines, aminophylline is indicated for the treatment of lung diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and COPD. The majority of aminophylline medications are discontinued and the remaining medications on the market are in short supply.\nThe molecule is a methylxanthine and derivative of theophylline. Aminophylline relaxes smooth muscles, particularly bronchial muscles. This xanthine most likely exerts its effect by inhibiting cAMP or cGMP phosphodiesterases, thereby increasing levels of the second messenger cAMP or cGMP intracellularly. Other mode of actions include an adenosine antagonistic effect on the activity of CD4 lymphocytes and mediator release from mast cells thereby decreasing lung sensitivity to allergens and other substances that cause inflammation. Aminophylline also acts as a CNS stimulant and exerts a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect on the heart.\nThe molecule is more soluble in water than theophylline but has similar pharmacologic actions. It's most common use is in bronchial asthma, but it has been investigated for several other applications."

Cangrelor was approved by the FDA in June 2015 for intravenous application."
